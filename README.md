Lab wraps Git or [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub), making it simple to clone, fork, and interact with repositories on GitLab, including seamless workflows for creating merge requests, issues and snippets.

```
$ lab clone gitlab-com/infrastructure

# expands to:
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/infrastructure
```

## hub + <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3167497/34473826-40b4987c-ef2c-11e7-90b9-5ff322c4966f.png" width="30" height="30"> = hublab??

lab will look for hub and uses that as your git binary when available so you don't have to give up hub to use lab
```
$ lab version
git version 2.11.0
hub version 2.3.0-pre9
lab version 0.17.2
```

# Inspiration

The [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) tool made my life significantly easier and still does! lab is heavily inspired by hub and attempts to provide a similar feel.

# Installation

Dependencies

* `git` or `hub`

### Homebrew
```
brew install zaquestion/tap/lab
```

### Scoop
```
scoop bucket add zaquestion https://github.com/zaquestion/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install lab
```

### Alpine
```
apk add lab
```

### Bash

Installs lab into `/usr/local/bin/`
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaquestion/lab/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```
NOTE: Please take care when executing scripts in this fashion. Make sure you
trust the developer providing the script and consider peaking at the install
script itself (ours is pretty simply ;)

### PreBuilt Binaries

Head to the [releases](https://github.com/zaquestion/lab/releases) page and download your preferred release

### Source

Required
* [Go 1.12+](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone git@github.com:zaquestion/lab
cd lab
go install -ldflags "-X \"main.version=$(git  rev-parse --short=10 HEAD)\"" .
```

or

```
make install
```

### Tests
See the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Configuration

`lab` needs your GitLab information in order to interact with to your GitLab
instance. There are several ways to provide this information to `lab`:

1. environment variables: `LAB_CORE_HOST`, `LAB_CORE_TOKEN`;
2. environment variables: `CI_PROJECT_URL`, `CI_JOB_TOKEN`;
    - Note: these are meant for when `lab` is running within a GitLab CI pipeline
3. directory-specific configuration file in [HashiCorp configuration language (HCL)](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl): `./lab.hcl`;
4. user-specific configuration file in HCL: `~/.config/lab.hcl`.

These are checked in order. If no suitable config values are found, `lab` will
prompt for your GitLab information and save it into `~/.config/lab.hcl`.
For example:
```
$ lab
Enter default GitLab host (default: https://gitlab.com):
Enter default GitLab token:
```
# Completions

`lab` provides completions for bash and zsh.

### Bash

`lab completion bash` will generate a bash completion script. Save this script and source it in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
source "/path/to/lab-completions.bash"
```

### Zsh

`lab completion zsh` will generate a zsh completion script. zsh completions are denoted with the syntax `_command-name`, so save the output of `lab completion` to a file name `_lab`. Place the file in your `$FPATH`, or create an new directory and add it to your `$FPATH`.

```zsh
fpath=(/path/to/script_directory $fpath)
```

# Aliasing

Like hub, lab feels best when aliased as `git`. In your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
```
alias git=lab
```
